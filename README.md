**PKeyboard** is a Persian virtual keyboard.

I needed a Farsi (Persian) virtual keyboard in one of my projects that was running on a PDA.



🔥 Features of PKeyboard:

	✅ Light, simple and beautiful
  
	✅ Create responsive virtual keyboard with JS
  
	✅ Keyboard display based on input type and inputmode
  
	✅ Has a shift key function
  
  	✅ Has the function of the Enter key
  
  	✅ Clear button function
  
  	✅ Respect maxlength
  
  	✅ Compliant with numeric input type behavior

  



❔ How does it work?

	1️⃣ First, add the JS and CSS file to your web page.

	2️⃣ Add a `data-pkeyboard` property to each of the inputs you need the virtual keyboard to be enabled for.

	3️⃣ Done!



😍 Now with the focus of each input, the keyboard corresponding to that input will be displayed.
